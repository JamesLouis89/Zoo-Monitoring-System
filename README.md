This program allows a user to create and store credentials for a login. The user can log into the program or click the create account button where they can create their credentials. After logging into the program the user can select monitor animals or monitor habitats. If monitor animals is selected the user can click different animals and within the screen there are notes about the animal and the user can add notes about the specific animal. The user then has the option to load all the records. If the user selects the monitor habitat a screen opens that displays some habitats that can be monitored. For example, if the user selects aquarium they can record the water pH. There is a conditional statement that checks to make sure that it is within normal range, if it isn't it displays a warning message. This information is also saved to a database. The program utilizes a SQLite database due to project requirements for another class.
